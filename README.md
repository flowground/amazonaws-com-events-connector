## API Description

<p>Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.</p>

## Actions

### DeleteRule
<blockquote><p>Deletes the specified rule.</p> <p>Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using <a>RemoveTargets</a>.</p> <p>When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>Managed rules are rules created and managed by another AWS service on your behalf. These rules are created by those other AWS services to support functionality in those services. You can delete these rules using the <code>Force</code> option, but you should do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using that rule.</p></blockquote>

### PutPermission
<blockquote><p>Running <code>PutPermission</code> permits the specified AWS account or AWS organization to put events to your account's default <i>event bus</i>. CloudWatch Events rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to your default event bus. </p> <p>For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have a CloudWatch Events rule with your account's default event bus as a target.</p> <p>To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your default event bus, run <code>PutPermission</code> once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same AWS organization, you can run <code>PutPermission</code> once specifying <code>Principal</code> as "*" and specifying the AWS organization ID in <code>Condition</code>, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.</p> <p>If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions when they use <code>PutTarget</code> to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEvents-CrossAccountEventDelivery.html">Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The permission policy on the default event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.</p></blockquote>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_

### PutRule
<blockquote><p>Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using <a>DisableRule</a>.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values.</p> <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.</p> <p>Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

### PutTargets
<blockquote><p>Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule.</p> <p>Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.</p> <p>You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>EC2 instances</p> </li> <li> <p>SSM Run Command</p> </li> <li> <p>SSM Automation</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Lambda functions</p> </li> <li> <p>Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams</p> </li> <li> <p>Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon ECS tasks</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Step Functions state machines</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Batch jobs</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS CodeBuild projects</p> </li> <li> <p>Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Inspector assessment templates</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SNS topics</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues</p> </li> <li> <p>The default event bus of another AWS account</p> </li> </ul> <p>Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are <code>EC2 CreateSnapshot API call</code>, <code>EC2 RebootInstances API call</code>, <code>EC2 StopInstances API call</code>, and <code>EC2 TerminateInstances API call</code>. </p> <p>For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html">Authentication and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions in the <code>Target</code> structure. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEvents-CrossAccountEventDelivery.html">Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about enabling cross-account events, see <a>PutPermission</a>.</p> <p> <b>Input</b>, <b>InputPath</b>, and <b>InputTransformer</b> are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>Input</b> is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, <code>$.detail</code>), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>InputTransformer</b> is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When you specify <code>InputPath</code> or <code>InputTransformer</code>, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.</p> <p>When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, <code>FailedEntryCount</code> is non-zero in the response and each entry in <code>FailedEntries</code> provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.</p></blockquote>
